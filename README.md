# Digital Signal Processing 2016 - 2017

Here you will find all the lectures for the class of Digital Signal Processing which I will be teaching throughout this year.

**Preparation for exam** (including theory subjects): see [here](PreparationForExam.pdf)

**Lectures [pdf]** You can view and download all lectures in PDF in the Lectures folder:

- [Lectures\00_Introduction.pdf](Lectures/00_Introduction.pdf)
- [Lectures\01_Sampling.pdf](Lectures/01_Sampling.pdf)
- [Lectures\02_SignalsAndSystems.pdf](Lectures/02_SignalsAndSystems.pdf)
- [Lectures\03_01_ZTransform.pdf](Lectures/03_01_ZTransform.pdf)
- [Lectures\04_FrequencyAnalysisOfDiscreteSignals.pdf](Lectures/04_FrequencyAnalysisOfDiscreteSignals.pdf)
- [Lectures\05_FrequencyAnalysisOfDiscreteSystems.pdf](Lectures/05_FrequencyAnalysisOfDiscreteSystems.pdf)

In the first three files, the slides are merged into full-page documents. In the last three files, there are slides exactly as I presented them in class (after the first three I changed the format).

Have fun!
